# xlink-test-tcp-server
This is a test tcp server built for the xlink 500 weather station. It should NOT be used in production!
The purpose of this code is to validate that the weather station is sending data. You'll need a static IP address
to configure with the weather station. This code was tested in GCP on a VM using Docker.
